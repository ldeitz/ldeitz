### Hello World! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Lauren here! I'm currently a healthcare data scientist ⚕️ at New York state's health information exchange. I've been a data practitioner for over 10 years, mostly in politics and grassroots organizing 🗳️. 

Most of my programming and data skills are self-taught -- I graduated college with an English literature degree, accidentally fell into data work, and quickly became passionate about data as a means to change the world for better 📈. Graduated May 2023 from Columbia University's QMSS program 📚, and proficient in SQL, Python, R, and data visualization tools. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-deitz-30b80456/) for more of my professional background!

For now, I'm using Github to store school projects. You'll find a package I wrote to identify birdwatching hotspots and some test repos I'm using to learn Databricks. More to come!

When I'm not working, you can find me running 🏃‍♀️, birdwatching 🔭, and walking my extremely cute dog 🐕
